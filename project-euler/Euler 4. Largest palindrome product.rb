# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# 1 possible solution: we could start making palindromes down from 999*999
# and check if they have two 3 digit factors (maybe via quadratic formula?)
# ..the first that does have two 3 digit factors would be our answer

# optimize brute force

# alternative method
# you can use % 10 to get the last digit(s)
# then left adjust the number by a 0 (*= 10)
# then adjust the input number. repeat till input is 0
# e.g. palindrome?(505)
# 0 *= 10 -> p is 0, 0 += 5 -> p is 5, 505 /= 10 -> n is 50
# 5 *= 10 -> p is 50, 50 += 0 -> p is 50, 50 /= 10 -> n is 5
# 50 *= 10 -> p is 500, 500 += 5 -> p is 505, 5 /= 10 -> n is 10. exit loop.
# i.e. we go from 505 to 500 & 5 to 50 & 50 to 5 and 500 back to 505.
